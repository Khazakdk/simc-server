The SimulationCraft team is comprised of volunteer developers from all
over the world. We are always looking for new contributors.  The team
consists of people of various backgrounds and skills.  Programming
skills (and especially C++ programming skills) are not necessary for
everything we do.
    
We are a very laid back group of developers. While certain project
members have areas of expertise, there is little in the way of strict
responsibility and ownership. Developers are expected to exercise their
initiative and help out wherever needed. The Google Code site provides
considerable utilities for oversight. The mantra is: Just check it in.
Don't ask for permission. If the code needs to be changed for
functional (or artistic!) reasons, senior developers might
revert/modify as needed.
    
Below are a set of topics to contribute on and their brief
descriptions. They are not listed in any order of importance. The need
for class specific contribution depends on the number of active
developers for a given class. The number of class developers is a very
dynamic quantity for many classes, so the best way to see if help is
needed is to ask about the current situation in IRC.
    
### Class/spec specific action lists
  
Class specific action list updates are more about writing well
functioning action lists in the Simulationcraft action list scripting
language, than writing C++. Updating default action lists inside the
actual source code is straightforward and requires no knowledge of
programming. Area of effect action lists are typically the ones needing
the most work.
    
### Class module development
  
Class module development does not require in-depth knowledge of C++,
however it does require some basic understanding of object oriented
programming. The class modules in Simulationcraft typically does not
require worrying about memory management, it is handled by the core
sim. The largest challenge in class development is to understand how to
map in game functionality to the conventions Simulationcraft uses to
model it.
    
### Documentation

[The wiki documentation](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki)
is always looking for helpers to improve and expand it or just keep it up to date with the development
of SimulationCraft. Here you can generate a big impact on the usability of the project while getting
to know the manifold options SimC offers yourself.
There is also the possibility to write usage guides here, either by creating new ones or reworking the Starters Guide.
