## Release 820-01 notes
  * **Healers are mostly not supported, and [currently have no developer working on them.](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc#how-can-i-contribute)**
  * Most DPS specializations and items for 8.2.0 implemented, see [here for more details.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSP_p5jJP5EpDJ7oTsRQtBZKuGR2O4gAclHhb3IoQy2WnL31p1Awe5RBXIEGMlteeakCXGkR1LD8LxB/pubhtml)
  * New [Blizzard API Profile character endpoints](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20772457051) in use for armory imports. This information includes full Azerite Esseence, and "drop level" support (for certain BfA leveling items). Note that downloads for characters that have not logged in for a while (after 2019-07-02) may not successfully load until several hours have passed. **As a known issue for this transition, guild imports are currently broken and will be fixed in the near future.**
  * Live hotfixes are included up to 2019-07-16
